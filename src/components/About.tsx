          I'm passionate about building responsive and modern web experiences.
          With over 8 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in crafting
          elegant UI/UX designs using modern frameworks like{" "}
          <span className="font-medium text-white">React</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-medium text-white">Angular</span>, along with
          the versatility of{" "}
          <span className="font-medium text-white">Tailwind CSS</span> for
          pixel-perfect styling.

          My journey began with a fascination for how technology can transform
          everyday interactions, driving me to master the art of merging clean,
          efficient code with visually stunning designs. I thrive on tackling
          challenging problemsâ€”whether it's optimizing performance or designing
          intuitive interfaces that truly connect with users.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-2xl">
          Currently, I'm channeling my energy into personal projects that push
          the boundaries of front-end development, while also mentoring emerging
          talent in the field. I'm all about sharing best practices,
          continuously learning, and keeping up with the latest trends in UI/UX.
